  <h3>Your Password: ntd4ftw3dyp7$ (Login)</h3>
  <p>When you click on "Forgot Password" on the homepage, an infographic about how to create a secure password pops up. You need a sentence, a number, and a symbol, which you will use to construct the password according to the instructions. The sentence, number, and symbol are revealed through the other pages "Clue 1", "Clue 2", and "Clue 3", respectively, found at the top right of the website.</p>
  <h3>Sentence: next time don't forget to write down your password (Clue 1)</h3>
  <p>Go to page 1 at the top right. Click on the first link under the google search (National Do Not Call Registry). Click "Register Your Phone". Click "REGISTER HERE". Click any of the text fields at the bottom of the page, which takes you to a form. Click the link at the top. At the top right of the website is a phone number (855) 411-2372. Enter this as 8554112372 as the phone number in the google form. After you submit the form, the message "Dear future self: 'next time don't forget to write down your password'" appears. The first letter of each word in "next time don't forget to write down your password" is used in the final password.</p>
  <h3>Number: 437 (Clue 2)</h3>
  <p>Go to page 1 of the website and take the quiz at the top of the page. Quiz Answers: REAL, REAL, FAKE, REAL, REAL </p>
  <p>Once you finish, the picture on the left becomes a link. Click on it to access a google form.</p>
  <p>Going back to the escape room website, there is a image of John Jones's checking account statement. Next to it is John's personal checkbook register where he keeps his own record of his transactions. Comparing the two records, it appears that there is an extra ATM Withdrawal - FIRST BANK with Ref. 0064 and amount of 100 that was not withdrawn by John according to his personal register. Enter that info into the google form from before. After you submit, you receive a message telling you that you received a new email and a link that takes you to view the email.</p>
  <p>The email is a phishing email that is supposedly from Netflix. When you click on "UPDATE PASSWORD", it takes you to a google form. The link at the top is an image of a fake credit card. Enter in the credit card information from the image into the form.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:10%">Name of Credit Card Holder: A. Miller</p>
  <p style="margin-left:10%">Credit Card Expiration Date (MM/YY): 12/20</p>
  <p style="margin-left:10%">Credit Card Number (no dashes or spaces): 4000123456789010</p>
<p>After you submit, the form says that you have been scammed, and that $437 have been billed to your credit card. 437 is the number clue.</p>
  <h3>Symbol: "$" at the end (Clue 3)</h3>
  <p>Go to page 3 and fill out the password strength form by going the website linked at the top of the form and copy and pasting the passwords to get the answers for how long it takes to crack the password. (the last question is actually the answer to the entire thing!) <br>Answers to form: Instantly, 2 minutes, 1 day, 2 hundred milliseconds, Instantly, 1 millisecond, 6 minutes, 8 hours, 12 thousand years
  <p>After you submit the form, a screenshot of a text conversation pops up. In the conversation, you told MoneyNotMagic through text that you were putting $ at the end of everything, which is why there is a $ at the end of your password.</p>
