This project was developed as a submission for PittChallenge, a Hackathon.

Employee burnout is a major concern for healthcare workers. Burnout among health workers harms both patient care and safety, including factors like decreaseed time spent with the patient, increased errors and infections, and staffing shortages. In response, to mitigate employee burnout, our team developed a Machine Learning model (Gradient Boosted Linear Regression) that creates optimal schedules for workers in order to minimize their burnout. Factors include: sleep duration, break frequencies, meals eaten, etc. Using a quick six-question questionaire, to be filled out once a week by employees, we can train a Machine Learning model for each employee, offering personalized insight into what habits minimize burnout.

We recognize that each employee has different preferences and lifestyles, so we trained a unique ML model for each employee based on their own data. When a certain employee did not have enough data (perhaps they are new to the company), we aggregated their data with randomly sampled data from other employees. As more time passes and a particular employee's data set grows, their model is trained on data that incorporates more of their own data and less of the aggregate data. This way, we can tailor each employee's suggestions better overtime, adjusting as needed.

More notes on the technical implementation are detailed in the Jupyter Notebook.
