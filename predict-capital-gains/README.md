In this project, I used U.S. Adult Census data from 1994 to predict whether someone has positive capital gains. This notebook documents my entire process, including data exploration, data cleaning, model selection, and model evaluation.
The data set is publically available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income.
To run the notebook, set the `filename` variable (code cell 3) as the path to the data set.
